# VAT 2.0
 
The new version of VAT. 

## Purpose
VAT is an interface for generating labeled data for physical sensors in a format that makes it accessible and easy to do from even non-technical users. The key to this process is by using _video annotation_. VAT provides the user with an interface that allows them to label 'events' in a video, which is synchronized to the raw data. These labels can then be used with machine learning to be able to automatically recognize the specified events from raw sensor data alone.

### Why VAT 2.0?
One of the primary hopes of the redesign is to use modular components that will make it easy to rapidly try multiple UI designs.
